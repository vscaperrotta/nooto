# Nōto

Nōto - ノート is a text editor based on Redux Persist to memorized your notes.

This website inspired from the work of Riccardo Palombo with Scrivi.la.
It's an exercise where I try to create memo archive with Redux Persist. I add some small features like change font and theme with a settings modal where the user can customize his experience.
